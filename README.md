# Trader Space Game

A small hobby roguelike made using the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine. Takes inspiration from the [Roguelike Tutorial](https://github.com/amethyst/rustrogueliketutorial), but self implemented and continues to diverge from the original.

Play as a lonely trading ship in the endless expanse of deep space. Each map contains randomly generated ships, planets and other interactive elements. Fight pirates, visit planets and space stations to trade, and much more. Use the wormhole to travel to the next map, see how far you can make it!

This game is currently a work in progress. There is no explicit objective, and features are still very barebones.

## Installation

Currently, the game is compiled for the latest versions of MacOS and Windows, as well as Ubuntu 20.04, using Github Actions. The game is tested with Windows and Ubuntu, so these are the only platforms I can make explicit promises for.

To play the game, head to the [releases](https://github.com/TimothyQuark/trader/releases) page, and download the relevant executable for your platform. You will also need to download and unzip the assets folder next to the executable, as it contains important files to play the game.

## Controls

* Use the `arrows keys` to move your spaceship. Use CMD and SHIFT with the arrow keys to move diagonally.
* Use the `arrow keys` to attack enemies in close range.
* Enter a wormhole or  explore a planet using the `E` key.
* Use the `.` key to wait for a turn.
